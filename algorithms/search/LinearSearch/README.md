# Linear Search
Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

## Complexity

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)` - since in worst case we're checking each element
exactly once.
