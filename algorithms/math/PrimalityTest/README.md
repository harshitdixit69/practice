# Primality Test

A **prime number** (or a **prime**) is a natural number greater than `1` that 
cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number 
greater than `1` that is not prime is called a composite number. For 
example, `5` is prime because the only ways of writing it as a 
product, `1 × 5` or `5 × 1`, involve `5` itself. However, `6` is 
composite because it is the product of two numbers `(2 × 3)` that are 
both smaller than `6`.
