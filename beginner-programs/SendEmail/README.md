# SMTP Email sending example

Sending a simple email over an SMTP server using Golang.

## Requirements

- Local golang installation

## Getting started

First, you need to add the settings of your SMTP server. If you don't have an SMTP server, you can use [ethereal](https://ethereal.email/) for testing purposes.

After that, you need to set the email details like the email address, subject, and body.

Then you can run the application using the following command.

```bash
go run email.go
```
